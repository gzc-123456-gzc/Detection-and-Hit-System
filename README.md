# Target interception system

**Overview**

The purpose of the system is to detect and intercept a particular target.
In order to simulate a real scenario, the system was divided into two ROS packages:
one used for simulating the world in Gazebo, the other being the system itself.


* **TO DO: update detection algorithm**
* **TO DO: C++ implementation**

**Prerequisites**
* Python 2.7 (TO DO: convert to python 3.6)
* ROS Kinetic Kame
* Gazebo 7.14


**System Structure**

The system is divided into subsystems which interact with each other
using ROS topics/services:
 * TODO


**ROS packages**

* **detect_target**
* **simulator_gazebo**
